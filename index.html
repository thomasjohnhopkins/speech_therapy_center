                them when our son was 22 months and we are so blessed to
                have had their support on our journey.  They have worked
                tirelessly with our son, helped to reveal his strengths and
                worked through challenges on all levels --  speech, fine/gross
                motor skills, play and social skills.  They have been, and are
